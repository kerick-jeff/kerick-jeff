### Hi there 👋

I'm Fru Kerick.

A senior software engineer with 7+ years of experience building and maintaining high-performance production systems serving 100,000+ users.

I work across PHP, Laravel, TypeScript, and Angular, designing backend architectures and strongly typed frontends that operate reliably under real traffic, high concurrency, and payment-sensitive workloads.

On the backend, I have:

- Led systems supporting 10,000+ concurrent users
- Improved API throughput by up to 100x through production profiling, query optimization, and data normalization
- Maintained p95 response times below ~200ms in data-intensive workloads
- Designed queue-driven and cache-backed architectures using Redis
- Implemented secure Stripe integrations (SCA, 3D Secure) with idempotent transaction handling
- Built resilient third-party integrations with rate limits and retry strategies

On the frontend, I have:

- Delivered Angular applications used by thousands of users daily
- Designed reusable, strongly typed API layers aligned with backend contracts
- Optimized client-side performance and state management in data-heavy interfaces

I care about correctness, observability, and maintainability. Systems should be predictable under load, resilient to failure, and understandable months later.

I build software that remains stable as it scales.
