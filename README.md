### Hi there 👋

I'm Fru Kerick.

A senior software engineer with 7+ years of experience building and maintaining high-performance production systems serving 100,000+ users.

I work across PHP, Laravel, TypeScript, and Angular, designing backend architectures and strongly typed frontends that operate reliably under real traffic, high concurrency, and payment-sensitive workloads.

On the backend, I have:

- Led systems supporting 10,000+ concurrent users
- Improved API throughput by up to 100x through production profiling, query optimization, and data normalization
- Maintained p95 response times below ~200ms in data-intensive workloads
- Designed queue-driven and cache-backed architectures using Redis
- Implemented secure Stripe integrations (SCA, 3D Secure) with idempotent transaction handling
- Built resilient third-party integrations with rate limits and retry strategies

On the frontend, I have:

- Delivered Angular applications used by thousands of users daily
- Designed reusable, strongly typed API layers aligned with backend contracts
- Optimized client-side performance and state management in data-heavy interfaces

I care about correctness, observability, and maintainability. Systems should be predictable under load, resilient to failure, and understandable months later.

Currently deepening my expertise in distributed systems, cloud-native infrastructure, and observability, working with:

- Docker and Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Go for high-concurrency backend services
- AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda) for scalable infrastructure
- Event-driven systems using RabbitMQ and Kafka
- gRPC and GraphQL for service communication
- Elasticsearch for search and analytics workloads
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Test-driven development across feature and unit levels
- Observability using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, and New Relic for metrics, tracing, and production monitoring

I am particularly interested in building resilient infrastructure for fintech, crypto, and payment-driven systems.
